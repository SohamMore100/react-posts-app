# React Posts App

This is a simple ReactJS application that displays a list of posts using the **GET** API and allows creating a new post using the **POST** API.

## 📌 Features

- Fetch and display posts from JSONPlaceholder API
- Submit a new post using a form
- Instantly show the new post at the top of the list

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- ReactJS
- Vite (for faster development)
- Axios (for API requests)
- JSONPlaceholder API

---

## 📂Note:

- This app uses a fake online REST API (JSONPlaceholder), so new posts are not saved permanently.
- New posts are shown immediately in the list using React state.
- Refreshing the page will reload only the original 20 posts from the API.(For Faster loading)
